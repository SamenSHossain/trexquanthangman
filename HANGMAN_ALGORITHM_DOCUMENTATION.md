## Key Innovations

### üéØ **Multi-Algorithm Architecture**
- **Early Game Strategy**: Length-based frequency optimization for first guesses
- **Mid Game Strategy**: Conditional probability with dynamic candidate filtering  
- **Late Game Strategy**: Direct pattern matching when few candidates remain

### üìä **Comprehensive Statistical Analysis**
- Word length distribution analysis (250,000 training words)
- Position-specific letter frequency (first, last, middle positions)
- Conditional frequency tables (letter co-occurrence patterns)
- Morphological pattern recognition (prefixes, suffixes, bigrams, trigrams)

### üîç **Dynamic Filtering System**
- Real-time candidate word filtering based on revealed patterns
- Multi-constraint validation (length, position, absence, frequency)
- Efficient regex-based pattern matching

## Algorithm Architecture

### Phase 1: Data Preprocessing & Analysis

#### 1.1 Dictionary Analysis Foundation
```python
# Core statistical structures
self.word_length_distribution = defaultdict(int)
self.letter_frequency_by_length = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))
self.position_frequency = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int)))
self.conditional_frequency = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))
```

**Key Insights Implemented:**
- Letter frequency varies dramatically by word length
- Position-specific analysis (first/last letters have different distributions)
- Conditional frequencies boost accuracy significantly

#### 1.2 Pattern Recognition Analysis
```python
# Advanced pattern structures
self.common_prefixes = defaultdict(int)
self.common_suffixes = defaultdict(int)
self.bigrams = defaultdict(int)
self.trigrams = defaultdict(int)
self.vowel_patterns = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))
```

### Phase 2: Core Algorithm Design

#### Algorithm Selection Logic
```python
def guess(self, word):
    # Determine game phase
    if self.game_phase == "early" and num_guessed == 0:
        return self._algorithm_1_length_based_frequency(clean_word)
    elif len(self.current_dictionary) <= 10:
        return self._algorithm_3_direct_pattern_matching(clean_word)
    else:
        return self._algorithm_2_conditional_probability(clean_word)
```

#### Algorithm 1: Length-Based Frequency Strategy (Early Game)
- **Purpose**: Optimal first letter selection based on word length
- **Key Feature**: Pre-computed optimal first letters for each word length
- **Insight**: 3-letter words favor 'A', 5-8 letter words favor 'S'/'E', 9+ letters favor 'E'/'I'

#### Algorithm 2: Conditional Probability Strategy (Mid Game)
- **Purpose**: Leverage revealed letters to boost prediction accuracy
- **Key Feature**: Dynamic probability adjustment based on letter co-occurrence
- **Implementation**: 
  ```python
  # Apply conditional frequency boosting
  for revealed_letter in revealed_letters:
      if letter in self.conditional_frequency[revealed_letter]:
          conditional_boost = self.conditional_frequency[revealed_letter][letter] / 1000.0
          score += conditional_boost
  ```

#### Algorithm 3: Direct Pattern Matching (Late Game)
- **Purpose**: Exact enumeration when candidate set is small
- **Key Feature**: Direct frequency counting in remaining candidates
- **Trigger**: Activates when ‚â§10 candidate words remain

### Phase 3: Dynamic Filtering System

#### Multi-Constraint Filtering
```python
def _update_candidate_dictionary(self, clean_word):
    for dict_word in self.full_dictionary:
        # 1. Length constraint
        if len(dict_word) != len(clean_word): continue
        
        # 2. Pattern matching with revealed letters
        if not re.match(clean_word, dict_word): continue
        
        # 3. Absence constraints
        for guessed_letter in self.guessed_letters:
            if guessed_letter not in clean_word and guessed_letter in dict_word:
                skip_word = True
        
        # 4. Frequency constraints (exact letter counts)
        revealed_letter_counts = Counter(c for c in clean_word if c != '.')
        for letter, count in revealed_letter_counts.items():
            if dict_word.count(letter) != count:
                skip_word = True
```
